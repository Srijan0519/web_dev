## This branch will contain all the exercise and practice files.

### Steps to access this branch in your local machine
Switch to task branch in github and press the code button which is green in color.
Now go to the empty space where you want this branch and open the git bash/cmd/powershell/terminal.

Write this command to clone the repository:
```
git clone [paste the link]
```

This command simply clone the master branch. To check the tasks branch, write this command:
```
git pull origin tasks
```
