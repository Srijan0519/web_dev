    <hr><hr>
 <p>Farmers are the backbone of India and the Indian Economy. Most of the Indian villages are still developing. Generally, farmers are poor in our country. Their life is simple. They cultivate the land and grow food. They are mostly illiterate. An Indian farmer is hard-working. He works hard in the field from morning till evening. Almost every farmer has a few cattle. He looks after them. He does not care for the dark clouds and the strong sun. He is ready to work all the time.The social condition of an Indian farmer is not very good. He lives in a joint family. He shares the joys and sorrows of the members of his family. He is generally helpful to other people in the village. A farmer spends a lot on certain occasions, although he lives in poverty. He always tries to save his social prestige and position. Sometimes he spends unnecessarily on litigation. For this he ma,y sell his land also.

He has no good facilities for irrigation.</li></ul> His cattle are weak and ill-fed. Besides, an Indian farmer remains unemployed for the most part of the year. So, his income is low. He does not have sufficient money for medicines or for the education of his children.

    
    The greatest sufferer in the present set up of the government is the farmer. The trade union and other services holders get the maximum attention of the government. But Indian farmers are not organized. So, they have to pay heavy taxes. But they receive the minimum benefits.
    
    
    However, time is changing fast. A farmer is being helped with money, fertilizers, and seeds. The crop insurance is also proposed. In fact, India’s progress largely depends on agriculture. So, a farmer is the backbone of a nation. Our government is trying to make a farmer’s future bright.
